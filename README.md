# nuxt-bridge-fonts-vite

## What is it?

This repository is a reproduction of particularly wrong local fonts handling when project bulds via vite. You need to build and run project and open DevTools.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
